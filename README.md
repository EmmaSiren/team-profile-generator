## **Description**

Generating a directory for a project team will be much simpler and easier using the node application I have created. This application uses Inquirer to ask the user questions about their team and uses the answers to auto generate an HTML file. Creating a team directory with this application provides a clean and quick way to get a simple and sleek HTML page as JavaScript and Node take on most of the work. By creating this application I was able to further practice usage of Node.js, Inquirer, and Jest. 

Jest was used to test the logic of my application's code and ensure it was functioning as desired. I gained a better understanding of how tests are written and executed properly to be actually helpful as well as why test driven code is so important to good functioning applications. 

## **Installation & Usage**
Initiate Node.js by running ‘npm i’ in the GitBash terminal. Once all packages have been installed simply run the ‘npm start’ command to run the application. This will begin the prompt of questions and ultimately write the HTML file using user inputted answers. To run the tests for this application's code please navigate in your terminal to the '\_\_tests__' folder then run the 'npm test' command. See below for walkthrough video.
